To create a project that allows users to upload profile pictures using Node.js and Express API, you can follow these steps. The project will handle image uploads using the multer middleware, which simplifies file handling in Node.js.

## Steps:
Set up a new Node.js project
Install necessary dependencies
Create a file upload route
Handle file uploads using multer
Serve static files (images)
Run the server and test the upload
### 1. Initialize a Node.js project
```
mkdir fileupload_express_multer_example
cd fileupload_express_multer_example
npm init -y
```
### 2. Install dependencies
```
npm install express multer
```
